# Snakegame_c-
Welcome to the classic Snake game! This project is a simple console-based implementation of the Snake game using C++.


## About

This project is a basic implementation of the Snake game. The objective of the game is to navigate the snake to eat the fruit, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the wall or its own tail. The player's score increases with each fruit eaten.

## Features

- Snake moves within a defined boundary.
- Snake grows longer with each fruit eaten.
- Score tracking.
- Adjustable difficulty levels.
- Pause and resume functionality.
- Displays the highest score for the current session.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- Windows operating system (due to the use of `<conio.h>` and `<windows.h>` libraries)

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
